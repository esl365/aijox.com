## Introduction

Dreaming of teaching English in South Korea? The E-2 visa is your ticket to living and working in one of Asia's most vibrant countries. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about the E-2 visa, from requirements to timeline.

The E-2 visa (also known as the English teaching visa or conversation instruction visa) is the most common visa for foreign English teachers in South Korea. It's specifically designed for native English speakers who want to teach conversational English at schools, hagwons (private academies), or universities.

<Callout type="info" title="Who Qualifies for E-2 Visa?">
Citizens from the following countries can apply for E-2 visas: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. You must also be a native English speaker from one of these countries.
</Callout>

## What is the E-2 Visa?

The E-2 visa is a teaching visa that allows you to work as an English teacher in South Korea for up to two years (with possibility of renewal). Unlike some other work visas, the E-2 is tied to a specific employer, meaning you cannot freely change jobs without going through the visa sponsorship process again.

### Key Features

- **Duration**: Typically issued for 1-2 years
- **Renewability**: Can be renewed multiple times
- **Employer-sponsored**: Your school must sponsor your visa
- **Single Activity**: Only allows teaching English (no other jobs)
- **Re-entry Permit**: Allows travel in and out of Korea

## E-2 Visa Requirements

Meeting all requirements is crucial for a successful application. Missing even one document can result in delays or rejection.

### Educational Requirements

<HighlightBox title="Education Requirements">
- **Bachelor's degree or higher** from an accredited university
- Degree must be from one of the seven eligible countries
- Field of study doesn't matter (any major qualifies)

</HighlightBox>

### Nationality Requirements

You must be a **citizen** (not just a resident) of one of these countries:
- United States

- South Africa

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Note">
Even if you're a native English speaker, you won't qualify for an E-2 visa unless you're a citizen of one of the seven eligible countries. Green card holders or permanent residents do not qualify.
</Callout>

### Health Requirements

All E-2 visa applicants must undergo health screenings:
- **HIV test** (negative result required)

### What is an Apostille?

An apostille is an official certificate that authenticates your documents for international use. It's required for your degree and criminal background check.

**How to get an apostille:**
1. **US citizens**: Contact your state's Secretary of State office
2. **UK citizens**: Use the UK government's apostille service
3. **Canadian citizens**: Contact Global Affairs Canada
4. **Australian citizens**: Use the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)

<Callout type="info" title="Processing Time">
Apostille processing typically takes 2-4 weeks. Some states offer rush services for an additional fee.

## E-2 Visa Application Process

The E-2 application process is handled mostly by your employer, but you're responsible for gathering documents.

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Find a Teaching Job**

Before you can apply for an E-2 visa, you need a job offer from a Korean school. The school will be your visa sponsor.

**2. Gather Documents**

Collect all required documents listed above. This typically takes 6-8 weeks due to apostille processing times.

**3. Employer Files Visa Issuance Number (VIN)**

Your Korean employer submits your documents to Korean immigration to obtain a Visa Issuance Number. This takes 2-4 weeks.

**4. Apply at Korean Embassy/Consulate**

Once you receive the VIN, take it to the nearest Korean embassy or consulate in your home country to apply for the actual visa. Required:
- Visa application form
- Passport
- Passport photo
- Visa Issuance Number
- Visa fee ($50-90 USD)

**5. Receive Your Visa**

Visa processing at the embassy typically takes 5-7 business days. You'll receive a visa sticker in your passport.

**6. Travel to Korea**

Book your flight! Your employer typically covers or reimburses your flight cost.

**7. Complete ARC Application**

Within 90 days of arrival, apply for your Alien Registration Card (ARC) at the local immigration office. This includes the health check.

## E-2 Visa vs Other Korean Teaching Visas

### E-2 vs F-Visa (Spousal/Family)

**F-visas** offer more flexibility - you can work any job and change employers freely. If you're married to a Korean citizen or have Korean family ties, an F-visa is better than E-2.

### E-2 vs E-7 (Special Occupations)

**E-7 visas** are for specialized workers and university professors. They offer more prestige but require higher qualifications (often a Master's degree and teaching experience).

### E-2 vs D-10 (Job Seeker)

**D-10 visas** allow you to enter Korea to search for a job, but you cannot start working until you convert to an E-2. Most teachers secure jobs remotely and apply for E-2 directly.

## Renewing Your E-2 Visa

E-2 visas are typically issued for 1 year initially, renewable for up to 2 years total at the same school. After 2 years, you can:

1. **Renew with current employer** (if permitted)
2. **Transfer to a new employer** (requires new visa sponsorship process)
3. **Apply for E-7 visa** (if you have a Master's + experience)
4. **Return home** and reapply later

### Transfer Process

Changing employers on an E-2 visa requires:
- Letter of release from current employer
- New employment contract
- New VIN application
- Immigration office visit

<Callout type="warning" title="Gap Between Jobs">
You should not have a gap in employment while on an E-2 visa. If you quit or are fired, you typically have 30 days to find a new employer or leave Korea.
