## Video Production Tips

### Before Recording

1. **Write a script**

   - Professional setting (home office, classroom, bookshelf)

3. **Test your setup**
   - Check lighting
   - Test audio quality
   - Verify camera angle

### Lighting Tips

**Natural Light:**
- Film facing a window
- Soft, diffused light is best
- Avoid direct sunlight (creates harsh shadows)

**Artificial Light:**
- Ring light positioned at eye level
- Two-point lighting for depth
- Avoid overhead lights (create shadows)

**Best time:** Morning or late afternoon for natural light

### Audio Quality

- **Test your microphone** before final recording

- **Use a quiet room** with minimal echo
- **Consider:** Hanging blankets to reduce echo

### During Recording

1. **Body language**
   - Sit up straight
   - Smile naturally
   - Make eye contact with camera
   - Use hand gestures (but keep them in frame)

2. **Speaking**
   - Speak clearly and at moderate pace
   - Vary your tone (avoid monotone)
   - Show enthusiasm
   - Pause between sections

3. **Energy level**
   - Higher energy than normal conversation
   - Think: TV presenter, not conversation
   - Stay animated throughout

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

2. **Reading from script** - Sounds robotic
3. **Too much information** - Focus on highlights
4. **Negative comments** - Never bad-mouth previous employers
5. **Irrelevant details** - Stay focused on teaching

### Technical Mistakes
1. **Poor lighting** - Dark, shadowy face
2. **Bad audio** - Echo, background noise
3. **Vertical video** - Use horizontal/landscape
4. **Shaky camera** - Use tripod
5. **Cluttered background** - Distracting items

### Presentation Mistakes

2. **Monotone delivery** - Sounds disinterested
3. **Too casual** - Inappropriate clothing/setting

5. **Rushed** - Speaks too fast

## What to Wear
